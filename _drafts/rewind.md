I've been re-reading the paltry few posts I wrote back in 2009, and I'm shocked at how naive I sound from where I sit now. True, a lot has changed, when I wrote those I worked on Betfair's Poker system. After that I stayed at Betfair for 4 more years, in 2 teams which exposed me to the distributed systems I'd been so desperate to learn about:

1. In the Distributed Systems team, working for the aforementioned [Dan Creswell](http://dancres.org).
2. Leading (and later working in) the Exchange team, working on re-engineering a high volume service (that's service in the sense of a logical entity providing >=1 network exposed well defined interfaces, rather than a single process).
