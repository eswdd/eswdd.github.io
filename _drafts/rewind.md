I've been re-reading the paltry few posts I wrote back in 2009, and I'm shocked at how naive I sound from where I sit now. True, a lot has changed, when I wrote those I worked on Betfair's Poker system. After that I stayed at Betfair for 4 more years, in 2 teams which exposed me to the distributed systems I'd been so desperate to learn about:

1. In the Distributed Systems team, working for the aforementioned [Dan Creswell](http://dancres.org).
2. 

When I moved this blog over to GitHub pages I re-read the paltry few posts I wrote back in 2009. I sound like a different person. But then it's been over 4 years since I wrote that.
